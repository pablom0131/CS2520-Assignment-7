## Project Summary
A game where the player takes control of tank and shoots various targets on the screen. There are different types of targets with different movement types and attacks. There is a scoreboard that keeps track of how many times the tank has shot, how many targets have been hit, the score (shots taken minus number of targets hit), and the type of projectile that the tank is currently shooting. Additionally, there is a bot tank that moves on its own and shoots when the player shoots but in a random directions.

## Game Instructions
**Tank Movement:** Use arrowkeys on keyboard. The left arrow key moves the tank to the left and the right arrow key moves the tank to the right.

**Shooting:** Keep your mouse within the game window since the game will track your cursor. Holding the left mouse button starts charging the tank's cannon, the longer you hold it, the higher velocity the tank's projectile will have.

**Changing Tank Projectiles:** Pressing E on the keyboard cycles through the three available projectile types: reg (regular projectile with normal radius and velocity), fast (faster projectiles with smaller radius and higher velocity), and slow (slower projectiles with bigger radius and slower velocity).
